Credit score classification is the process of predicting the creditworthiness of a loan applicant based on their financial and personal information. It is a common application of data analytics and machine learning in the financial industry.

Different methods and techniques can be used for each step, depending on the data and the business objectives.A global finance corporation, has amassed a substantial dataset comprising essential banking details and an extensive repository of credit-related data. 

Driven by the need for enhanced efficiency and accuracy, the company's management has initiated project to create a robust system based on credit score classification model. The project aims to develop an intelligent system employing data science and machine learning to automate the categorization of individuals into specific credit score brackets.The visionary of the project serves a dual purpose.

Firstly, it seeks to alleviate the manual effort involved in credit assessment, optimizing operational processes.
